# Vertex Delta 3D Printer unofficial firmware
An unofficial firmware for the Vertex Delta 3D printer based on Marlin
Marlin documentation can be found on [The Marlin Wiki](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/wiki)

This is not a fork of Velleman's firmware, but it is made from scratch using the latest available Marlin.

## Danger
I take no responsability for the use you make of the firmwares found here. You are fully responsible of any damages you do. The firmwares are released "as is". I have nothing to do with Velleman and I do this on my own. You can flash back to the official firmware even after using this firmware if by any means you were to dislike the improvements.

## Installing

## Marlin License
Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.
While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

## My own license
I am under Marlin's licence, so GPL. If you use these modifications for your commercial product, a little thank you or gesture would be nice :)
